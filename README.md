# Pokédex

This project is a sort of visualisation of the PokéAPI in a cool and simple GUI.

## Features

- List all pokemons using pages
- Search through all the pokemons using the english name
- Change the display language between English and French (not the search one we're sadly limited by the API)
- Add pokemons to a favorite category so that you can find your favorite pokemons easier
- Pokemon info (Everything can be translated):
    - Name
    - Type
    - Sound
    - Sprites (Back and front when available)
    - Height and Weight
    - Abilities (Name and description)
    - Base stats

## What's missing

Nothing feature-wise! We can still improve the design with more detail or improve the code, notably the cache optimization parts that has been done really quickly.

We could add more languages or add a way to make it dynamical. Actually the languages are entered directly in the code.
If languages were added dynamically, we would need to redesign the language toggle.
